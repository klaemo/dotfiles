# Clemens' Dotfiles

## How to install

The installation step may overwrite existing dotfiles in your HOME directory.

```bash
$ bash -c "$(curl -fsSL raw.github.com/klaemo/dotfiles/master/bin/dotfiles)"
```

N.B. If you wish to fork this project and maintain your own dotfiles, you must
substitute my username for your own in the above command and the 2 variables
found at the top of the `bin/dotfiles` script.

## How to update

You should run the update when:

* You make a change to `~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig` (the only file that is
  copied rather than symlinked).
* You want to pull changes from the remote repository.
* You want to update Homebrew formulae and Node packages.

Run the dotfiles command:

```bash
$ dotfiles
```

Options:

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><code>-h</code>, <code>--help</code></td>
        <td>Help</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>--no-packages</code></td>
        <td>Suppress package updates</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>--no-sync</code></td>
        <td>Suppress pulling from the remote repository</td>
    </tr>
</table>


## Features

### Automatic software installation

Homebrew formulae:

* git
* htop
* [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
* [rsync](https://rsync.samba.org/) (latest version, rather than the out-dated OS X installation)
* [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/)
* [httpie](https://github.com/jkbrzt/httpie)

### Local/private zsh configuration

Any private and custom zsh commands and configuration should be placed in a
`~/.zsh_extra` file. This file will not be under version control or
committed to a public repository. If `~/.zsh_extra` exists, it will be
sourced for inclusion in `zsh_env`.

Here is an example `~/.zsh_extra`:

```bash
# PATH exports
PATH=$PATH:~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin
export PATH

# Git credentials
# Not under version control to prevent people from
# accidentally committing with your details
GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Clemens Stolle"
GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="clemens@example.com"
GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"
# Set the credentials (modifies ~/.gitconfig)
git config --global user.name "$GIT_AUTHOR_NAME"
git config --global user.email "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL"

# Aliases
alias code="cd ~/Code"
```

N.B. Because the `git/gitconfig` file is copied to `~/.gitconfig`, any private
git configuration specified in `~/.extra` will not be committed to
your dotfiles repository.
